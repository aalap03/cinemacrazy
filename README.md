This Project uses TMDB API to fetch movies and tv series of different categories like trending, now playing, latest etc. 

This project is written in Kotlin and uses google's architecture components, like LiveData, Paging library, Room databse for data persistence, MVVM architecture.

Also used new library ViewPager2 to display images related to Tv series and Movies, also to display videos trailers of movies and seriesc, 
I have used PictureInPicture APIs.
